<h1>Time notes</h1>
<h2> This is something I am going to try for winter 2019. As finals season is upon us, I am going to attempt to 
document my day everyday in addition to 3 things I could have done that day to make it more productive in order to properly
study for finals. </h2>

<ul>
<li> March 21st '19 </li>
  <ul>
    <li>Deep work hr count: 2.5 hrs outside of classes</li>
    <li>Improvements for tomorrow:</li>
    <ul>
      
      <li>No social media 2 hrs into waking up </li>
      <li>Sit in first two rows of lecture hall (info. comes much easier)</li>
      <li>Have a physical copy of todo list and make tasks more accessible for anywhere work</li>
    </ul>  
  </ul>
<li> March 22nd '19 </li>
  <ul>
    <li>Deep work hr count: x hrs outside of classes</li>
    <li>Side note: Mind actually blown to the limits in 205, prof is actually a legend - has this ability to excite people about ideas.
    We talked about how Magenta is actually not a color but rather just the brain freaking out because of an absence of green being present when R and B value are present. 
    Also talked about how fourier is used in jpeg resolution - Fourier is actually next level stuff</li>
    
    <li>Implementations on improvements from yesterday :</li>
    <ul>
      
      <li>No social media 2 hrs into waking up: failed. I have this tendency to check my phone - have to implement a better solution </li>
      <li>Sit in first two rows of lecture hall (info. comes much easier): check </li>
      <li>Have a physical copy of todo list and make tasks more accessible for anywhere work: check </li>
    </ul>
