<h1>Time notes</h1>
<h2> This is something I am going to try for winter 2019. As finals season is upon us, I am going to attempt to 
document my day everyday in addition to 3 things I could have done that day to make it more productive in order to properly
study for finals. </h2>

<ul>
<li> March 21st '19 </li>
  <ul>
    <li>Deep work hr count: 2.5 hrs outside of classes</li>
    <li>Improvements for tomorrow:</li>
    <ul>
      
      <li>No social media 2 hrs into waking up </li>
      <li>Sit in first two rows of lecture hall (info. comes much easier)</li>
      <li>Have a physical copy of todo list and make tasks more accessible for anywhere work</li>
    </ul>  
  </ul>
<li> March 22nd '19 </li>
  <ul>
    <li>Deep work hr count: 0 hrs outside of classes</li>
    <li> Tbh, March 22nd  was not too great academically. Had classes from 8:30 to 5:30 and was running on very low amounts of sleep. 
      A few things also came up on the personal front that I had to deal with. Just gotta learn and move forward though I guess</li> 
      
    <li>Implementations on improvements from yesterday :</li>
    <ul>
      
      <li>No social media 2 hrs into waking up: failed. I have this tendency to check my phone - have to implement a better solution </li>
      <li>Sit in first two rows of lecture hall (info. comes much easier): check </li>
      <li>Have a physical copy of todo list and make tasks more accessible for anywhere work: check </li>
    </ul>  
    <li>Improvements for tomorrow  :</li>
    <ul>
      
      <li>In response to 1 yesterday, leave phone at home and don't check social media unitl start/end of study sess </li>
      <li> Sleep by 9 pm </li>
      <li> Meal prep for the day after: I got decent at this until I got disorganized again and started eating out.</li>
    </ul>  
    <li>Ongoing habits to maintain:</li>
    <ul>
      
      <li>Sit in first two rows of lecture hall (info. comes much easier): check </li>
      <li>Have a physical copy of todo list and make tasks more accessible for anywhere work: check </li>
    </ul>  
  </ul>
  
  <li> reason for not keeping this up to date is because keeping track of all activities is much harder than it seems. Therefore, finding a way to make this loop a little easier. Will hopefully figure out over the weekend
  and be able to be better at this</li>
</ul>
